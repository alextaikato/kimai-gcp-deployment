# Step 4 - Create application deployment

# Now that we have a cluster running, we need to deploy our Kimai database and application to it.

# Tangle the code blocks below to create the kubernetes resource yaml files and the shell script that will apply the scripts within our cluster.

# The first file is the database deployment, which will create a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL][MySQL]] database pod. Adjust the credentials to suit your environment.
